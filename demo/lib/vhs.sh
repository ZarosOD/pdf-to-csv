# Recipe: VHS. Records a terminal session from a tape file. Generic: do not
# edit per project — the per-piece file is demo/demo.tape.
#
# This was demo/lib/bootstrap.sh in the first portfolio piece, when VHS was the
# only recipe. It keeps the toolchain bootstrap and gains the two functions
# demo/record.sh calls; ffmpeg and the Chromium libraries moved to their own
# files because the Playwright recipe needs them too.
#
# Contract with record.sh:
#   recipe_bootstrap        fetch whatever this recipe needs
#   recipe_record OUT_DIR   leave a clip in OUT_DIR
